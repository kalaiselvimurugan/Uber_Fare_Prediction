# Uber_Fare_Prediction
# UBER Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms in Python

## Overview

This project aims to predict the **"UBER Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms in Python"** focuses on predicting the **fare amount** of Uber rides based on their **travel time and other relevant features** using **Machine Learning**.

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

---

## Methodology

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of the Uber dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Feature selection and transformation.
- Model training using various Machine Learning algorithms.
- Evaluation of each model using appropriate performance metrics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Jupyter Notebook (via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment for isolation
  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kalaiselvimurugan/Uber_Fare_Prediction.git
   cd Uber_Fare_Prediction
   ```   

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   
5. **Run the Notebook**
   ```bash
   Open notebooks/uber_fare_prediction.ipynb and run the cells step-by-step.
   ```


## Model Selection

- Multiple algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) are trained and compared.
- Performance is measured using metrics like:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R¬≤ Score
- The **best-performing model** is selected based on comparative study.

---

## üß™ Testing Phase

- The selected model is evaluated on a **testing dataset**.
- Comparison is made between training and testing performance to avoid overfitting or underfitting.

---

## üìà Visualization

- Graphs are used to visualize:
  - Feature correlation
  - Model accuracy
  - Residual plots
  - Prediction vs Actual fare amounts
